The use of blockchain for video watermarking in a copyright protection system can significantly influence both performance and responsiveness. Here are the key implications: (1) as more videos are watermarked and registered on the blockchain, the size of the blockchain grows. This can affect the speed of transaction validation and block creation. Digital watermarking methods are commonly used to safeguard digital media copyrights by confirming ownership and deterring unauthorized use. However, without reliable third-party oversight, these methods risk security vulnerabilities during watermark extraction.

The term generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that is capable of generating text, images, sound or other data (Bäck, 2023).Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be both useful for journalism but also extremely challenging as it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish genuine human-generated content from AI-produced content. Blockchain-based copyright transfer systems also enable efficient licensing and payment processes. By automating royalty payments and licensing agreements, creators can focus on creating new content rather than managing administrative tasks. ...

However, copyright protection necessitates a strong watermark. For resolving a variety of intelligence-related issues, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are solid options. Although it works well for watermarking, it is less effective at more common tasks like regression, classification, and prediction. 2.1 Current Status of the Content. In 2019, sales in the content industry increased 5.9% year-on-year and 6.0% annually from 2015 to 2019 to 126.7123 trillion won. By industry, the publishing industry accounted for the largest portion with 21.3412 trillion won (16.8%) and the broadcasting industry was 20.84 trillion won (16.4%), the second largest industry after the publishing industry. The widespread, unauthorized use of digital images in Consumer Electronics (CE) often leads to serious copyright infringement issues. However, current digital image copyright protection schemes have the drawbacks of the large cost of computing and storage resources, low efficiency, and susceptibility to quantum attacks. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel quantum ... Nonetheless, the integration of these cutting-edge advancements in smart technology gives rise to serious concerns regarding privacy and security. Solutions to these issues can potentially be found by fusing blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing (Fig. 1). However, copyright protection necessitates a strong watermark. For resolving a variety of intelligence-related issues, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are solid options. Although it works well for watermarking, it is less effective at more common tasks like regression, classification, and prediction. Advancements in digital technologies make it easy to modify the content of digital images. Hence, ensuring digital images' integrity and authenticity is necessary to protect them against various attacks that manipulate them. We present a deep learning (DL) based dual invisible watermarking technique for performing source authentication, content authentication, and protecting digital content ...

Therefore, in addition to consider the tool property and human prerequisite in copyright domain following with the traditional regulations, this study suggested that intelligence efforts should be crucial factor for clarifying the responsibility between AI machines and humans, which is associated with copyright concerns, legal and ethical ... In the dynamic landscape of music and technology, the surge of Generative AI has ushered in a new era of creativity, enabling tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E to enhance our writing and artistic…\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI have found some relevant information. There isn't a single, definitive research paper that perfectly outlines a blockchain and AI-based watermarking scheme. However, the search results suggest the following key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Blockchain for Immutable Copyright Records:** Blockchain can be used to create immutable records of ownership, making it difficult to alter or manipulate copyright information.\n",
      "*   **AI for Robust Watermarking:** AI and machine learning techniques can be used to create more robust and resilient watermarks that are resistant to tampering and removal.\n",
      "*   **Synergy of Blockchain and AI:** The combination of blockchain and AI can address challenges in digital copyright protection, data integrity, and secure data transmission. Several articles mention the potential of this combination.\n",
      "*   **Watermarking AI-Generated Content:** There is growing interest in using watermarking to identify AI-generated content and protect against copyright infringement.\n",
      "*   **Challenges and Solutions:** The large data volume and stringent confidentiality requirements pose challenges for direct registration on blockchain platforms, which can be addressed by blockchain-based copyright protection models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this information, a research project could explore the following areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Developing a Blockchain-Based Watermarking System:** Design a system that uses blockchain to store and manage copyright information, and AI to embed and detect robust watermarks in digital content.\n",
      "2.  **AI-Powered Watermark Generation:** Use AI to generate adaptive watermarks that are tailored to the specific characteristics of the digital content, making them more difficult to remove.\n",
      "3.  **Watermark Verification and Enforcement:** Develop AI-based techniques for automatically detecting watermarks and enforcing copyright restrictions.\n",
      "4.  **Blockchain-Based Copyright Management:** Create a blockchain-based platform for managing copyright licenses and royalty payments.\n",
      "5.  **Addressing Challenges:** Investigate solutions for addressing the challenges of large data volume and confidentiality requirements in blockchain-based copyright protection.\n",
      "6.  **Security Analysis:** Conduct a thorough security analysis of the proposed system to ensure its resistance to attacks and vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer:While a single research paper combining all aspects of blockchain and AI for watermarking doesn't exist, research can be crafted focusing on combining blockchain's immutable ledger with AI's robust watermarking capabilities to enhance copyright protection, particularly for AI-generated content. Key areas include developing a blockchain-based watermarking system, using AI for adaptive watermark generation, creating AI-based verification techniques, and addressing challenges like data volume and security.\n",
