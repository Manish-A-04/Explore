GPT-1 which was released in 2018 contains 117 million parameters having 985 million words.
GPT-2 which was released in 2019 contains 1.5 billion parameters.
GPT-3 which was released in 2020 contains 175 billion parameters. Chat GPT is also based on this model as well.
GPT-4 model is released in the early 2023 and it is likely to contain trillions of parameters.
GPT-4 Turbo was introduced in late 2023, optimized for speed and cost-efficiency, but its parameter count remains unspecified.

Decoding and Output Generation


GPT-3: GPT 3 is developed by OpenAI, stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3. This model powers ChatGPT and is widely recognized for its ability to generate human-like text across a variety of applications.
BERT: It is created by Google, is commonly used for natural language processing tasks and generating text embeddings, which can also be utilized for training other models.
RoBERTa: RoBERTa is an advanced version of BERT, stands for Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach. Developed by Facebook AI Research, it enhances the performance of the transformer architecture.
BLOOM: It is the first multilingual LLM, designed collaboratively by multiple organizations and researchers. It follows an architecture similar to GPT-3, enabling diverse language-based tasks.


Code Generation: LLMs can generate accurate code based on user instructions for specific tasks.
Debugging and Documentation: They assist in identifying code errors, suggesting fixes, and even automating project documentation.
Question Answering: Users can ask both casual and complex questions, receiving detailed, context-aware responses.
Language Translation and Correction: LLMs can translate text between over 50 languages and correct grammatical errors.
Prompt-Based Versatility: By crafting creative prompts, users can unlock endless possibilities, as LLMs excel in one-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.


Natural Language Understanding (NLU): 

Large language models power advanced chatbots capable of engaging in natural conversations.
They can be used to create intelligent virtual assistants for tasks like scheduling, reminders, and information retrieval.


Content Generation: 

Creating human-like text for various purposes, including content creation, creative writing, and storytelling.
Writing code snippets based on natural language descriptions or commands.


Language Translation: Large language models can aid in translating text between different languages with improved accuracy and fluency.
Text Summarization: Generating concise summaries of longer texts or articles.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing and understanding sentiments expressed in social media posts, reviews, and comments.

LLMs can perform zero-shot learning, meaning they can generalize to tasks for which they were not explicitly trained. This capability allows for adaptability to new applications and scenarios without additional training.
LLMs efficiently handle vast amounts of data, making them suitable for tasks that require a deep understanding of extensive text corpora, such as language translation and document summarization.
LLMs can be fine-tuned on specific datasets or domains, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation to specific use cases or industries.
LLMs enable the automation of various language-related tasks, from code generation to content creation, freeing up human resources for more strategic and complex aspects of a project.


High Costs: Training LLMs requires significant financial investment, with millions of dollars needed for large-scale computational power.
Time-Intensive: Training takes months, often involving human intervention for fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance.
Data Challenges: Obtaining large text datasets is difficult, and concerns about the legality of data scraping for commercial purposes have arisen.
Environmental Impact: Training a single LLM from scratch can produce carbon emissions equivalent to the lifetime emissions of five cars, raising serious environmental concerns.
